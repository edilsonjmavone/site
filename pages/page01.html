   <h1>Dynamic images</h1>
   <p>
        I'm learning how to make sites that can be acessed from many devices like PCs, Tablets,  <br> Smartphones our even Smart TVs all of these devices have different screen sizes.
        <br> So I need to make sure the sites look good on all screen sizes, starting with the images
   </p>

   <p>
    The image below may appear completely normal, but if you are viewing the site through your computer just try to resize your browser window
   </p>

   <picture>
    <source media="(max-width:700px)" srcset="../images/foto-p.png" type="image/png">
       <source media="(max-width: 1050px)" srcset="../images/foto-m.png" type="image/png">
       <img src="../images/foto-g.png" alt="exemple image">
   </picture>
   <p>
    Yes, it is true the image changes as you adjust the window size.
    This feature is realy helpful. <br>
    If you are accessing the site through a smartphone, the image probably has "P",
    try to rotate the screen, you should now be seeing an "M"
